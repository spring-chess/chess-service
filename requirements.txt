What ChessService should do
1. Store and manage chess games

This is its core purpose.

Create a new game

Store game participants (white, black)

Store the board state (FEN)

Store move history

Store game status (ongoing, checkmate, draw, resigned)

2. Validate moves

Using chesslib, the service becomes the “source of truth.”

Receive a move from the frontend

Load the current FEN

Ask chesslib if the move is legal

If legal → update FEN and save

If illegal → reject the request

3. Enforce turns

The backend decides whose turn it is, not the UI.

4. Prevent cheating

If someone bypasses your UI and sends an illegal API move, the server blocks it.

5. Serve game state to the frontend

Endpoints like:

/api/chess/{gameId} → full game

/api/chess/{gameId}/fen → board state

/api/chess/{gameId}/moves → move list

The frontend uses these to render the board.

6. Authenticate users using JWT

This ensures:

Only logged-in players can play

Only the right players can move pieces in a game

Spectators can still fetch but not modify game state (if you allow that)

7. Support multiplayer flow

For example:

Player A makes a move

Backend validates and saves

Player B fetches updated game state

Later, you can add WebSockets if you want real-time updates.

What ChessService should not do
1. It should NOT handle login, registration, or passwords

That stays in UserService. ChessService only validates JWTs, not users.

2. It should NOT control the chess UI

The React frontend with chess.js and react-chessboard handles the board and animations.

3. It should NOT generate HTML, render UI or push graphics

Backend stores and validates data only.

4. It should NOT store users or manage accounts

No users table.
UserService owns that.

5. It should NOT rely on the frontend for move validation

Frontend validation is optional sugar for the user.
Backend validation is mandatory.

6. It should NOT become a monolith

It should stay isolated with:

its own repo

its own database

its own deployment

its own Spring app

7. It should NOT generate JWT tokens
